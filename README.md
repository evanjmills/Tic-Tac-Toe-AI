# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
My friend challenged me to make a Tic Tac Toe game that included an AI that could not be beat.

The game is a basic Tic Tac Toe game which only took me about an hour to create.

The AI is just a version of the MiniMax algorithm which calculates all of the possible outcomes then chooses the best move
based on the possible moves that the other player can choose.

Over all the whole project took me about 5 hours to complete and deepend my understanding of the MiniMax algorithm.
